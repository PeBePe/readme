Already revolutionizing audiovisual communication, it's a trend that will only grow more explosively\u2014and who better than National Geographic to create a how-to book aimed directly at the millions who carry a camera phone everywhere and want to make the most of it? Created by two top professionals, this generously illustrated nuts-and-bolts guide is the first of its kind to treat these units as genuine cameras instead of novelties, and the only one to include a full-color photo-essay demonstrating the full capabilities of the latest camera phones. In five easy-to-read chapters, the book explains how to choose good equipment; take better pictures; and store, print and send the best images. Readers will find practical tips on preventing or repairing water damage, protecting easily-scratched lenses inside pockets and purses, and retrieving accidentally-erased images. They'll also learn to access the events, advice, and opportunities of the burgeoning camera phone community, from film festivals to news organizations, moblogs, and more. Featuring the technical savvy of CNet.com's Aimee Baldridge and the creative skill of National Geographic photographer Robert Clark, a camera phone pioneer, this compact yet comprehensive reference combines up-to-the-minute expertise with superb examples, at an inexpensive price that makes it a perfect gift book\u2014or an ideal impulse buy.",

      "description": "This surprising study draws together the disparate fields of postcolonial theory and book history in a challenging and illuminating way. Robert Fraser proposes that we now look beyond the traditional methods of the Anglo-European bibliographic paradigm, and learn to appreciate instead the diversity of shapes that verbal expression has assumed across different societies. This change of attitude will encourage students and researchers to question developmentally conceived models of communication, and move instead to a re-formulation of just what is meant by a book, an author, a text. Fraser illustrates his combined approach with comparative case studies of print, script and speech cultures in South Asia and Africa, before panning out to examine conflicts and paradoxes arising in parallel contexts. The re-orientation of approach and the freshness of view offered by this volume will foster understanding and creative collaboration between scholars of different outlooks, while offering a radical critique to those identified in its concluding section as purveyors of global literary power.",

Today\u2019s readers rely on this beautifully illustrated text to provide up-to-date detail of contemporary medical practice, presented in a style that is concise and yet easy to read. Davidson\u2019s provides the factual knowledge required to practise medicine, explaining it in the context of underlying principles, basic science and research evidence, and shows how to apply this knowledge to the management of patients who present with problems rather than specific diseases. The book has won numerous prizes including being highly commended in the British Medical Association book awards. Davidson\u2019s global perspective is enhanced by the input of an international team of authors an a distinguished International Advisory Board from 17 countries. Building on the foundations laid down by its original editor, Davidson\u2019s remains one of the world\u2019s leading and most respected textbooks of medicine. The underlying principles of medicine are described concisely in the first part of the book, and the detailed practice of medicine within each sub-specialty is described in later system-based chapters. Most chapters begin with a two-page overview of the important elements of the clinical examination, including a manikin to illustrate the key steps in the examination of the relevant system. A practical, problem-based clinical approach is described in the \u2018Presenting Problems\u2019 sections, to complement the detailed descriptions of each disease. The text is extensively illustrated, with over 1000 diagrams, clinical photographs, and radiology and pathology images. 1350 text boxes present information in a way suitable for revision, including 150 clinical evidence boxes summarising the results of systematic reviews and randomised controlled trials and 65 \u2019In Old Age\u2019 boxes highlighting important aspects of medical practice in the older population. A combined index and glossary of medical acronyms contains over 10 000 subject entries. The contents can also be searched comprehensively as part of the online access to the whole book on the StudentConsult platform. Access over 500 self-testing questions with answers linked to the book\u2019s content for further reading. The text uses both SI and non-SI units to make it suitable for readers throughout the globe. A new chapter specifically on Stroke Disease recognises the emergence of Stroke Medicine as a distinct clinical and academic discipline. A rationalisation of the 1350 boxes used throughout the book gives a simpler and clearer presentation of the various categories. New \u2018In Adolescence\u2019 boxes recognise the fact that many chronic disorders begin in childhood and become the responsibility of physicians practising adult medicine. These boxes acknowledge the overlap \u2018transitional\u2019 phase and highlight the key points of importance when looking after young people. The regular introduction of new authors an editors maintains the freshness of each new edition. On this occasion Dr Ian Penman has joined the editorial team and 18 new authors brng new experience and ideas to the content and presentation of the textbook. An expanded International Advisory Board of 38 members includes new members from several different countries.",

      "title": "Harry Potter Page to Screen: Updated Edition",
      "description": "Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded now has more pages devoted to the legacy of the Harry Potter films. In addition to the complete history of all eight Harry Potter films, the book now explores the theme parks in Florida, California and Japan, the sets and props in Leavesden, England and the House of MinaLima, founded by the graphic designers on all of the films, and located in London. With 1200 photographs, sketches, and diagrams, the book provides unbridled access to every aspect of the film-making process. It tells the stories behind each individual film and covers the design and technology behind all the astounding effects. This book pays homage to how one film became eight, how a few months became a decade, and how one author\u2019s fantasy became the project of many individuals\u2019 lifetimes-told by the people who were there, the people who made the magic real. Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded will start from the very beginning, describing how the book was optioned, the casting of Harry, Ron and Hermione, and the assembling of a creative team with the vision to tackle a world we had previously seen only in our imaginations. Interviews, quotes, and stories from the directors, producers, screenwriters, and actors discuss the making of all eight films at length, including the last film, film number 8, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2. Daniel Radcliffe and his personal narrative from set to set is used as the life line that connects all aspects of this memoir, giving structure to the many voices of the Harry Potter family who orate this tale. All of the movies were filmed at the Leavesden Studio in Hertfordshire, England and these pages describe how the Leavesden family dealt with numerous cast, crew, and production dramas, replacements, technical difficulties and countless narrative and visual decisions. This book will touch on subjects such as J.K. Rowling\u2019s private comments to her young cast, the impact of Richard Harris\u2019 (the original Dumbledore) death on the cast and crew, the effects of 9/11 on the Leavesden family (during the filming of Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets), the reality of \"growing up Potter\" for the young starlets who experienced their adolescence on a hugely public stage, and reflections from the cast and crew on the end of the film series. In addition to stories on and off set, Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded pays tribute to the stunning physical, visual and technological genius that went into making an unbelievable story believable, showcasing more than a decade\u2019s worth of art and special effects, including never-before-seen photos of the costumes, sets, props, and creatures, as well as early concept art, drawings and designs. The book is fully supported by Warner Bros. and is being put together with the same group as Harry Potter Film Wizardry: The Updated Edition. While Film Wizardry provided a whimsical and informative scrapbook for Harry Potter fans and was published prior to the release of the last film, this mammoth book gives readers a more complete account of the entire film-making process, designed in a more classical, sophisticated package. Harry Potter Page to Screen: Revised and Expanded is a publishing event. This book is the Bible for everything Potter and will stand as the most complete and final visual history of the Harry Potter movie story ever to be published.",

      "title": "Coding Literacy",
      "description": "How the theoretical tools of literacy help us understand programming in its historical, social and conceptual contexts. The message from educators, the tech community, and even politicians is clear: everyone should learn to code. To emphasize the universality and importance of computer programming, promoters of coding for everyone often invoke the concept of \u201cliteracy,\u201d drawing parallels between reading and writing code and reading and writing text. In this book, Annette Vee examines the coding-as-literacy analogy and argues that it can be an apt rhetorical frame. The theoretical tools of literacy help us understand programming beyond a technical level, and in its historical, social, and conceptual contexts. Viewing programming from the perspective of literacy and literacy from the perspective of programming, she argues, shifts our understandings of both. Computer programming becomes part of an array of communication skills important in everyday life, and literacy, augmented by programming, becomes more capacious. Vee examines the ways that programming is linked with literacy in coding literacy campaigns, considering the ideologies that accompany this coupling, and she looks at how both writing and programming encode and distribute information. She explores historical parallels between writing and programming, using the evolution of mass textual literacy to shed light on the trajectory of code from military and government infrastructure to large-scale businesses to personal use. Writing and coding were institutionalized, domesticated, and then established as a basis for literacy. Just as societies demonstrated a \u201cliterate mentality\u201d regardless of the literate status of individuals, Vee argues, a \u201ccomputational mentality\u201d is now emerging even though coding is still a specialized skill.",

The publication first offers information on finite fields and coding theory and combinatorial constructions and coding. Discussions focus on self-dual and quasicyclic codes, quadratic residues and codes, balanced incomplete block designs and codes, bounds on code dictionaries, code invariance under permutation groups, and linear transformations of vector spaces over finite fields. The text then takes a look at coding and combinatorics and the structure of semisimple rings. Topics include structure of cyclic codes and semisimple rings, group algebra and group characters, rings, ideals, and the minimum condition, chains and chain groups, dual chain groups, and matroids, graphs, and coding. The book ponders on group representations and group codes for the Gaussian channel, including distance properties of group codes, initial vector problem, modules, group algebras, andrepresentations, orthogonality relationships and properties of group characters, and representation of groups. The manuscript is a valuable source of data for mathematicians and researchers interested in the mathematical theory of coding.",

It develops a new model of online communication, incorporating mass communication and interpersonal communication. Interactive mass communication redefines the roles of online communication partners who are confronted with a higher degree of complexity in terms of hypertextual information units. In web advertising, this new aspect of interactivity is linguistically reflected in different types of personal address forms, directives, and \"trigger words\". This study also analyzes the different strategies of persuasion with which web ads try to initiate their activation.Web Advertising provides essential information on the language of web advertisements for academics, researchers and students in the fields of hypertext-linguistics, advertising, communication and media studies.",

      "description": "The Web has not been hyped enough. That's the startling thesis of this one-of-a-kind book that's sure to become a classic work of social commentary. Just as Marshall McLuhan forever altered our view of broadcast media, Weinberger shows that the new medium of the Web is not only altering social institutions such as business and government but, more important, is transforming bedrock concepts of our culture such as space, time, the public, and even reality itself. Weinberger introduces us to denizens of this new world, among them Zannah, whose online diary turns self-revelation into play; Tim Bray, whose map of the Web reveals what's at the heart of the new Web space; and Danny Yee and Claudiu Popa, part of the new breed of Web experts we trust despite their lack of qualifications. Through stories of life on the Web, an insightful take on some familiar (and some unfamiliar) Web sites, and a wicked sense of humor, Weinberger puts the Web into the social and intellectual context we need to begin assessing its true impact on our lives. The irony, according to Weinberger, is that this new technology is more in tune with our authentic selves than is the modern world. Funny, provocative, and ultimately hopeful, Small Pieces Loosely Joined makes us look at the Web -- and at life -- in a new light. From Small Pieces Loosely Joined: The Web has sent a jolt through our culture, zapping our economy, our ideas about the sharing of creative works, and possibly even institutions such as religion and government. Why? How do we explain the lightning charge of the Web? If it has fallen short of our initial hopes and fears about its transformational powers, why did it excite those hopes and fears in the first place? Why did this technology hit our culture like a bolt from Zeus? Suppose -- just suppose -- that the Web is a new world we're just beginning to inhabit . . . If the Web is changing bedrock concepts such as space, matter, time, perfection, public, knowledge, and morality -- each a chapter of this book -- no wonder we're so damn confused. That's as it should be. The Web is enabling us to rediscover what we've always known about being human: we are connected creatures in a connected world about which we care passionately . . . If this is true, then for all of the over-heated, exaggerated, manic-depressive coverage of the Web, we'd have to conclude that the Web in fact has not been hyped enough.",

Metode itu, disadari atau tidak, tergambar dalam tiga poin besar: Vision (Visi), Belief (Keyakinan), dan Action (Tindakan). Ketiganya merupakan kesatuan. Satu saja terpisahkan tak akan berhasil. Penulis membahas metode kesatuan itu berdasarkan pengalamannya dan kejeliannya menyerap ilmu dari orang-orang sukses dan meramunya menjadi sebuah metode. Metode itu terbukti. Metode itu bisa dipelajari. Banyak orang tahu tentang visi, keyakinan, dan tindakan, tapi hanya sedikit yang tahu cara mengikatnya.

      "description": "Setiap perusahaan di mana pun berada di dalam menjalankan kegiatan usahanya selalu terkait dengan lingkungan hidup, dan agar lingkungan tetap baik dan sehat, perusahaan berkewajiban untuk menjaga, merawat, dan memeliharanya dengan terus-menerus secara berkesinambungan. Meskipun dikehendaki demikian, masih ditemukan peristiwa kerusakan maupun pencemaran lingkungan hidup yang terjadi di masyarakat lebih banyak dilakukan oleh perusahaan sewaktu menjalankan kegiatan bisnisnya. Akibat yang ditimbulkan dari peristiwa tersebut, tampaknya tidak selalu segera diantisipasi oleh perusahaan, padahal perbuatannya menimbulkan kerugian pada masyarakat yang ada di sekitarnya. Buku ini membahas persoalan-persoalan di bidang hukum tersebut, terutama mengenai pelanggaran pidana lingkungan hidup yang dilakukan korporasi, tentang gugatan \u201cclass-action\u201d di bidang lingkungan hidup, dan masalah atau isu pencabutan izin lingkungan bagi perusahaan yang melanggar aturan lingkungan hidup. Oleh karena itu, buku ini berguna bagi para mahasiswa, dosen, pengacara, polisi, jaksa, dan hakim serta warga masyarakat yang ingin mempelajari hukum lingkungan hidup berkaitan dengan pemidanaan korporasi, gugatan class-action dan pencabutan izin lingkungan Buku persembahan penerbit PrenadaMediaGroup #Kencana",

Artinya, tanpa ada vibrasi pelengkap, yaitu \"\"rasa\"\" yang pasti memperkaya nuansa pemahaman diri, karena SCC (sub-conscious communicasi) sebenarnya sangat dalam-kaya-kuat dalam membentuk interkomunikasi sehingga menjadi multi-makna. \"\"Inner journey\"\" (perjalanan SCC), yang seperti inilah yang mendorong gairah menuliskannya demi membagi pemahaman sehingga bisa meningkatkan keharmonisan hubungan walau masih terasa kehadiran nuansa perbedaan. Dengan pemahaman underlying communication (bahasa yang tersamar), mampu mendekatkan perbedaan, menguraikan keruwetan karena kurang selaras, serta mempertemukan dua kutub yang berbeda.",

      "description": "South African born Elon Musk is the renowned entrepreneur and innovator behind PayPal, SpaceX, Tesla, and SolarCity. Musk wants to save our planet; he wants to send citizens into space, to form a colony on Mars; he wants to make money while doing these things; and he wants us all to know about it. He is the real-life inspiration for the Iron Man series of films starring Robert Downey Junior. The personal tale of Musk's life comes with all the trappings one associates with a great, drama-filled story. He was a freakishly bright kid who was bullied brutally at school, and abused by his father. In the midst of these rough conditions, and the violence of apartheid South Africa, Musk still thrived academically and attended the University of Pennsylvania, where he paid his own way through school by turning his house into a club and throwing massive parties. He started a pair of huge dot-com successes, including PayPal, which eBay acquired for $1.5 billion in 2002. Musk was forced out as CEO and so began his lost years in which he decided to go it alone and baffled friends by investing his fortune in rockets and electric cars. Meanwhile Musk's marriage disintegrated as his technological obsessions took over his life ... Elon Musk is the Steve Jobs of the present and the future, and for the past twelve months, he has been shadowed by tech reporter, Ashlee Vance. Elon Musk: How the Billionaire CEO of Spacex and Tesla is Shaping our Future is an important, exciting and intelligent account of the real-life Iron Man.",

      "description": "Perkembangan perbankan syariah di tingkat internasional telah mendapat momentum sejak 1970-an. Perkembangan yang dimaksud secara umum mengambil dua pola, yakni: pertama, mendirikan bank syariah berdampingan dengan bank konvensional (dual banking system), seperti yang terjadi di Mesir, Malaysia, Arab Saudi, Yordania, Kuwait, Bahraian, Bangladesh, dan Indonesia. Kedua, merestrukturisasi sistem perbankan secara keseluruhan sesuai dengan syariat Islam (full fledged islamic financial system) seperti yang terjadi di Sudan, Iran, dan Pakistan. Pola dual banking dalam konteks Indonesia tidak dimaksudkan untuk selamanya. Hal ini dibuktikan dengan adanya pengaturan mengenai keharusan melakukan pemisahan Unit Usaha Syariah Bank Umum Konvensional dalam jangka waktu maksimal 15 tahun pasca-diundangkannya Undang-Undang Nomor 21 Tahun 2008 tentang Perbankan Syariah. Oleh karena itu, peranan regulasi menjadi titik krusial dalam kedua model tersebut karena seluruh inisiasi awal perbankan syariah dimulai dengan dukungan regulasi yang memadai.",

Developing games has never been easier than it is now. New web technology allows even beginner developers to turn their hand to game development. Developed from an undergraduate course module, Introducing JavaScript Game Development teaches each new technology as it is introduced so can be followed by enthusiastic beginners as well as intermediate coders. You will learn how to work with HTML5 and the canvas element, how to understand paths, how to draw to a design and create your spaceship and asteroids. You\u2019ll then move on to animating your game, and finally building. You will work step-by-step through the game design process, starting with only what is necessary to complete each step, and refactoring the code as necessary along the way, reflecting the natural progression that code follows in the real world. Each chapter is designed to take your code base to the next level and to add to your skills. After completing the examples in this book you will have the tools necessary to build your own, high-quality games. Make the process of creating object-oriented 2D games more fun and more productive and get started on your game development journey.",

      "description": "Develop and use bots in video gaming to automate game processes and see possible ways to avoid this kind of automation. This book explains how bots can be very helpful in games such as multiplayer online games, both for training your character and for automating repetitious game processes in order to start a competition with human opponents much faster. Some players might use bots for cheating or avoiding game rules to gain an advantage over opponents - a sophisticated form of hacking that includes some elements of artificial intelligence (AI). However, while Practical Video Game Bots considers these topics, it is not a cheater's guide. Rather, this book is an attempt to overcome the information vacuum regarding bot development in video game applications. Through the use of three case study game examples, it covers most methods and technologies that are used by bot developers, and the details of anti-cheating systems. This book provides answers and useful advice for topics such as process automation, reverse engineering, and network applications. Modern bot applications use technologies from all these domains. You will also consider the work mechanisms of different kinds of bots and will write simple prototypes. What You Will Learn Discover bots and apply them to game applications Use clicker bots with OS-level embedding data, output-device capture, and more Develop in-game bots, with process memory analysis and access Work with out-game bots, with network interception and embedding data Deal with input device emulation and OS-level interception data Who This Book Is For Those with some prior experience in game development and coding experience in Python, C++, and Windows APIs.",

Visiting small hotels and simple campsites, and savoring vast dark-sky reserves where the night sky is actively protected, The Million-Star Hotel celebrates the black skies of yesteryear \u2013 which may become a reality for more and more of us as modern technology reins in lighting and puts it only where needed. How can you prepare for your stay beneath the stars? What astronomy can you do during the daytime? What kind of equipment will you need? Questions such as these are answered, and if town dwellers return inspired \u2013 and, Bob hopes, also inspired to look with fresh eyes at their own local lighting \u2013 there is enough information here for them to equip themselves for some urban astronomy too.",

      "title": "Rock Star/Movie Star",
      "description": "During the mid-1950s, when Hollywood found itself struggling to compete within an expanding entertainment media landscape, certain producers and studios saw an opportunity in making films that showcased performances by rock 'n' roll stars. Rock stars eventually found cinema to be a useful space to extend their creative practices, and the motion picture and recording industries increasingly saw cinematic rock stardom as a profitable means to connect multiple media properties. Indeed, casting rock stars for film provided a tool for bridging new relationships across media industries and practices. From Elvis Presley to Madonna, this book examines the casting rock stars in films. In so doing, Rock Star/Movie Star offers a new perspective on the role of stardom within the convergence of media industries. While hardly the first popular music culture to see its stars making the transition to screen, the timing of rock's emergence and its staying power within popular culture proved fortuitous for a motion picture business searching for its place in the face of continuous technological and cultural change. At the same time, a post-star-system film industry provided a welcoming context for rock stars who have valued authenticity, creative autonomy, and personal expression. This book uses illuminating archival resources to demonstrate how rock stars have often proven themselves to be prominent film workers exploring this terrain of platforms old and new - ideal media laborers whose power lies in the fact that they are rarely recognized as such. Combining star studies with media industry studies, this book proposes an integrated methodology for writing media history that combines the actions of individuals and the practices of industries. It demonstrates how stars have operated as both the gravitational center of media production as well as social actors who have taken on a decisive role in the purposes to which their images are used.",

      "description": "Computer science and economics have engaged in a lively interaction over the past fifteen years, resulting in the new field of algorithmic game theory. Many problems that are central to modern computer science, ranging from resource allocation in large networks to online advertising, involve interactions between multiple self-interested parties. Economics and game theory offer a host of useful models and definitions to reason about such problems. The flow of ideas also travels in the other direction, and concepts from computer science are increasingly important in economics. This book grew out of the author's Stanford University course on algorithmic game theory, and aims to give students and other newcomers a quick and accessible introduction to many of the most important concepts in the field. The book also includes case studies on online advertising, wireless spectrum auctions, kidney exchange, and network management.",

On a stormy summer night, Lord Byron and his guests are gathered round the fire. Felix, their serving boy, can't wait to hear their creepy tales. Yet real life is about to take a chilling turn- more chilling than any tale. Frantic pounding at the front door reveals a stranger, a girl covered in the most unusual scars. She claims to be looking for her sister, supposedly snatched from England by a woman called Mary Shelley. Someone else has followed her here too, she says. And the girl is terrified. This breathtaking new book from Emma Carroll, the critically-acclaimed author of Frost Hollow Hall, The Girl Who Walked On Air, In Darkling Wood and The Snow Sister, is a deliciously creepy story inspired by the creation of Frankenstein, and is brought to life by a leading talent in children's literature.",

Jutaan ahli dan para orang tua yang merasa khawatir telah menanyakan pertanyaan ini kepada diri mereka sendiri selama setidaknya lima puluh tahun. Ketika video game mulai bermunculan pada tahun tujuh puluhan, kebanyakan orang melihatnya sebagai keseruan belaka, tetapi seiring dengan meningkatnya jumlah penggemar video game, bahkan pada dekade tersebut, kalangan akademik mulai menyebut video game sebagai 'gangguan bodoh', dan para pemain game sebagai 'orang-orang dungu'. Hal ini berlanjut sampai baru-baru ini, dan sangat banyak artikel yang ditulis untuk meremehkan video game dan pemain game. Walaupun begitu, keadaan mulai berubah, dan para 'ahli' dengan angkuh mulai menyuarakan segi positif dari video game terhadap para pemain game...bahkan mereka yang masih sangat muda. Sementara semua perdebatan mengenai hal ini memanas, para pemain game tetap melakukan hal yang paling mereka gemari - bermain video game. Banyak hal yang telah ditulis mengenai bagaimana video game sangat memikat kalangan anak muda pada tahun tujuh puluhan, dan mengapa sekarang, baik orang tua maupun anak muda gemar bermain game. Ada yang menyukai game RPG, ada yang senang mengambil resiko di dalam dunia virtual, dan ada juga yang gemar mengasah kemampuan yang biasanya tidak mereka gunakan. Bahkan ada beberapa yang bermimpi menjadi bagian dari jajaran pemain game elite yang merupakan jutawan. Apapun alasan Anda, semoga anda mendapatkan kesenangan dari hobi Anda, dan may the Force be with you. Dalam e-book ini terkandung informasi mengenai berbagai video game, game komputer, arcade dan topik-topik yang terkait, yang disusun dalam 16 babak yang masing-masing terdiri dari sekitar 500-600 kata.

Human beings are able to adapt to changing conditions and to pursue their interests by the integrated use of various communicative means, mainly verbal, perceptual and cognitive. The core unit is the dialogic action game or \u2018the mixed game\u2019 with human beings at the centre acting and reacting in cultural surroundings. The key to opening up the complex whole is human beings\u2019 nature. The Mixed Game Model demonstrates how the different disciplines of the natural and social sciences and the humanities are mutually interconnected. After a detailed overview of the state of the art, the fundamentals of the theory are laid down. They include a typology of action games which ranges from minimal games to complex institutional games. The description is illustrated by analyses of authentic games.",

      "description": "For most people, animals are the most significant aspects of the nonhuman world. They symbolize nature in our imaginations, in popular media and culture, and in campaigns to preserve wilderness, yet scholars habitually treat animals and the environment as mutually exclusive objects of concern. Conducting the first examination of animals' place in popular and scholarly thinking about nature, Anna L. Peterson builds a nature ethic that conceives of nonhuman animals as active subjects who are simultaneously parts of both nature and human society. Peterson explores the tensions between humans and animals, nature and culture, animals and nature, and domesticity and wildness. She uses our intimate connections with companion animals to examine nature more broadly. Companion animals are liminal creatures straddling the boundary between human society and wilderness, revealing much about the mutually constitutive relationships binding humans and nature together. Through her paradigm-shifting reflections, Peterson disrupts the artificial boundaries between two seemingly distinct categories, underscoring their fluid and continuous character.",

      "description": "Peter Sahlins\u2019s brilliant new book reveals the remarkable and understudied \u201canimal moment\u201d in and around 1668 in which authors (icluding La Fontaine, whose Fables appeared in that year), anatomists, painters, sculptors, and especially the young Louis XIV turned their attention to nonhuman beings. At the center of the Year of the Animal was the Royal Menagerie in the gardens of Versailles, dominated by exotic and graceful birds. In the remarkable unfolding of his original and sophisticated argument, Sahlins shows how the animal bodies of the menagerie and others (such as the dogs and lambs of the first xenotransfusion experiments) were critical to a dramatic rethinking of governance, nature, and the human. The animals of 1668 helped to shift an entire worldview in France \u2014 what Sahlins calls Renaissance humanimalism \u2014 toward more modern expressions of Classical naturalism and mechanism. In the wake of 1668 came the debasement of animals and the strengthening of human animality, including in Descartes\u2019s animal-machine, highly contested during the Year of the Animal. At the same time, Louis XIV and his intellectual servants used the animals of Versailles to develop and then to transform the symbolic language of French absolutism. Louis XIV came to adopt a model of sovereignty after 1668 where his absolute authority is represented in manifold ways with the bodies of animals and justified by the bestial nature of his human subjects. 1668: The Year of the Animal in France explores and reproduces the king\u2019s animal collections \u2014 in printed text, weaving, poetry, and engraving, all seen from a unique interdisciplinary perspective. Sahlins brings the animals of 1668 together and to life as he observes them critically in their native habitats \u2014 within the animal palace itself by Louis Le Vau, the paintings and tapestries of Charles Le Brun, the garden installations of Andr\u00e9 Le N\u00f4tre, the literary work of Charles Perrault and the natural history of his brother Claude, the poetry of Madeleine de Scud\u00e9ry, the philosophy of Ren\u00e9 Descartes, the engravings of S\u00e9bastien Leclerc, the trans_fusion experiments of Jean Denis, and others. The author joins the non_human and human agents of 1668 \u2014 panthers and painters, swans and scientists, weasels and weavers \u2014 in a learned and sophisticated treatment that will engage scholars and students of early modern France and Europe and readers broadly interested in the subject of animals in human history.",

      "description": "Animals and Society uses a variety of historical sources and a coherent social theory to tell the story of the invention of animal rights. It moves from incidents like the medieval execution of pigs to a discussion of the politics and strategies of modern rights organisations. The book also presents radical interpretations of nineteenth-century animal welfare laws, and the accounts of the Noble Savage. The insights generated by social science are always at the core of the discussion and the author daws on the work of Michel Foucault, Norbert Elias, Claude Levi-Strauss and Mary Douglas. This wide-ranging and accessible book provides a fascinating account of the relations between humans and animals. It raises far-reaching questions about the philosophy, history and politics of animal rights.",

      "title": "The Regulation of Animal Health and Welfare",
      "description": "The Regulation of Animal Health and Welfare draws on the research of scientists, lawyers, economists and political scientists to address the current and future regulatory problems posed by the issues of animal health and disease. Recent events such as the outbreak of mad cow disease, epidemics of foot and mouth disease, concerns about bluetongue in sheep, and the entry into the food chain of the offspring of cloned cattle, have heightened awareness of the issues of regulation in animal disease and welfare. This book critically appraises the existing regulatory institutions and guiding principles of how best to maintain animal health in the context of social change and a developing global economy. Addressing considerations of sound science, the role of risk management, and the allocation of responsibilities, it also takes up the theoretical and practical challenges which here \u2013 and elsewhere \u2013 attend the co-operation of scientists, social scientists, lawyers and policy makers. Indeed, the collaboration of scientists and social scientists in determined and regulatory contexts such as that of animal disease is an issue of ever-increasing importance. This book will be of considerable value to those with interests in this issue, as well as those concerned with the law and policy relating to animal health and welfare.",

      "description": "This book offers ethical and political approaches to issues that nonhuman animals face. The recent \u2018political turn\u2019 in interspecies ethics, from ethical to political approaches, has arisen due to the apparent lack of success of the nonhuman animal movement and dissatisfaction with traditional approaches. Current works largely present general positions rather than address specific issues and principally rely on mainstream approaches. This book offers alternative positions such as cosmopolitan, libertarian, and left humanist thought, as well as applying ethical and political thought to specific issues, such as experimentation, factory farming, nonhuman political agency, and intervention. Presenting work by theorists and activists, insights are offered from both ethics and politics that impact theory and practice and offer essential considerations for those engaging in interspecies ethics within the political turn era.",
